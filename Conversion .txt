To convert an ER model to a database schema :

1. Identify the entities in ER model

2. For each entity, identify the attributes that describe the properties or characteristics of the entity.

3. Identify the relationships between the entities. Relationships represent the associations or connections between entities.

4. Determine the cardinality of each relationship, which defines how many instances of one entity are associated with instances of another entity.

5. Identify the primary key for each entity. The primary key uniquely identifies each record or instance of the entity.

6. Determine the foreign keys that establish relationships between entities. Foreign keys are attributes that reference the primary key of another entity.

7. Define additional constraints or rules that need to be enforced on the data, such as uniqueness, referential integrity, and data types.
